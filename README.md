# Training-Day -- Uploaded everything to the same repository have been moving it to its proper folders

1 assignment : Took string and read it into an array. Read the array and the first element into a temp variable then
compared it to the next item of the array if it was the same I took it and printed it to the screen if not I continued the loop

2: assignment 2 to check to see if it the word being read in is a palindrom I read the word into an array and broke it in half.
Then comparing one half to the other if they matched it was a palindrome if not I returned not a palindrome.

3: For divisible by 2 I checked for values that could be divided by both, then by 3 then by 5, returning the appropriate message to the console with the use of modular division to get integer whole number

4:Tested for the anagrams still have the same matching characters after comparing them to each other if they did they are anagrams.

5 could not really get this one, because the matrix refused to print. But I added handcodded values to the matrix in order to print them with a for loop with an index to test each
